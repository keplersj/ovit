This is a hack to do an unscramble single-pass of a fsid with a few
seatbelts to make sure that you really have the keys, and it really
works, and that you're not about to trash valid code.

Note.. unscramble.o will keep on caching the keys and will cause all
the mfs_stream/mfs_export stuff to mistakenly re-scramble the already
unscrambled data.  rmmod/insmod unscramble.o to flush its caches, and
then run a csoscout.tcl pass to clear the cso values so that tivoapp
can play it.
