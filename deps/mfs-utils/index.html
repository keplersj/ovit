<p>
The sourceforge project page for mfs-utils is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mfs-utils">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
One upon a time in a country far, far away, Andrew Tridgell, aka
tridge, wrote a package called <a
href="http://cvs.samba.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/tivo/vplay/"><b>vplay</b></a>.
Vplay provided a library and collection of tools for accessing data
and video streams stored on a TiVo in the <b>M</b>edia <b>F</b>ile
<b>S</b>ystem.
</p>
<p>
Over time, many developers have contributed extensions to this package
that never found their way back into tridge's vplay package.  This
package, retitled mfs-utils, is a unification of the many vplay
branches that developed over the past few years.
