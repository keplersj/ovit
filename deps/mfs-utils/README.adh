To build for S1:
make ARCH=ppc

To build for S2:
make ARCH=mips

.o files are in obj.$(ARCH)
executables are in bin.$(ARCH)

The MYARCH stuff lets the Makefile automagically work the same whether
you are building on a PC or building on the TiVo itself.  The undesirable
side effect is that if your PC is MIPS or PPC based, it will break.

Most of the generated binaries have not been tested.
